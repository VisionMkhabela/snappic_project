# snappic_project

Just a few reminders before running the project.

a) Make sure you clone the project via the terminal else some files will be treated like executables

b) After cloning, using your terminal navigate to the project directory and pod install, if you dont have cocoapods in your machine you should download them since some parts of the project depends on external libs.
